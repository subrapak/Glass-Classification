# Glass-Classification
Low level example of Logistic Regression and KNN classifier to predict glass types based on Al content.

# Description
A low level walkthrough of two main classification methods - K nearest neighbours and Logistic Regression. A number of low level helper functions were written for a ground up implementation of K nearest neighbours (e.g. finding Euclidean distance, etc) and Logistic Regression (e.g. finding the log likelihood) on the same dataset. The KNN classifier used multiple features whilst the Logistic Regression code was written only for a single classifier. The performance of this was then compared to the sklearn's `LogisticRegression()` model, which did not always yeild as high an accuracy.
